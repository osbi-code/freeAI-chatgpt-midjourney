# freeAI-chatgpt-midjourney
A free AI project for technical exchange and learning maintained by members of the Blockchain LUNC Validator node  

Websites we work with: [https://www.bistudio.com.cn](https://www.bistudio.com.cn)

# What we offer
- We purchase official AI services such as ChatGPT, MidJourney ,through formal channels and provide them free of charge to members of the LUNC Validator Node to use for testing  
- Provide a technology exchange and support platform on how to better utilize AI and realize the full open application of AI to BI (Business Intelligence).

# Why are we doing this 
- Helping to make AI more accessible to the masses and using AI to improve productivity
- Help enterprises realize smarter BI and better serve C-suite AI
- Help Validator Node: "BI.Studio, attract more people to join it and stay competitive in the blockchain

# How to do it
1. We started by choosing a premium LUNC node operator to work with on the Terra blockchain: Bi.Studio
2. We continuously invest in LUNC and entrust the validator node "BI.Studio" to automate the realization of compounding investment, i.e. the Chinese "Profit Rolling".
3. With the wealth gained through compounding, take out a portion to buy AI services such as ChatGPT\Midjourney
4. Looking for great github AI projects to serve as front-end UI interfaces for AI services, like as [chatgpt-web-midjourney-proxy](https://github.com/Dooy/chatgpt-web-midjourney-proxy)、[lobe-chat](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat)
5. Set up the KEY in the UI project and make it available to members for free

# limit
1. LUNC node: the operation of BI.Studio directly determines the continuity of the free service
2. When we find that the free service is being abused at an unaffordable cost, we will terminate the service. We don't switch to a paid service, we just stop it, because charging goes against our original intention
3. Since we are a free service, please understand that sometimes the speed will be slower when there are more people using the service or when it is abused.
